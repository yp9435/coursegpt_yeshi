# 🎓 CourseGPT – The AI-Powered Course Maker

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **CourseGPT**, a fun little project I (Yeshaswi, aka [@yp9435](https://github.com/yp9435)) built as part of the **Kalvium Technical Round Interview**.

The idea?  
Make course creation super quick and easy, with a bit of help from AI. Whether you’re building something educational, fun, or niche, CourseGPT helps you get it done fast. Just give it a topic, and boom, you’ve got a full course ready to go. I wanted to name it something different tho.

## ✨ What It Can Do

### Generate Full Courses with AI
Just tell the app what topic you’re interested in, and it’ll create an entire course — chapters, descriptions, durations, all powered by **Google Gemini AI**.

### Add YouTube Videos Instantly
The app uses the **YouTube Data API** to find and add relevant videos for each chapter automatically.

### Edit Anything, Anytime
AI wrote something cringey and cheesy just like this ReadME? You can tweak chapter names, descriptions, and video links however you like. Had to edit this readme multiple times lol.

### 🎮 Retro UI
The whole thing has a fun, old-school gaming look thanks to **NES.css** (really cute css styling i love it).

## Why I Made This

I built CourseGPT to show what I can do, combining full-stack development with AI and building a smooth user experience. It’s practical, a little playful, and something I genuinely had fun creating.
